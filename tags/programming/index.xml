      <description>J1 is a concise, interpreted array programming language which looks infamously like line noise. It is the successor to APL, which is a concise, interpreted array programming language which looks infamously like hieroglyphics.
Because J uses only ASCII characters, it has to condense a lot of meaning into a constrained symbol set. This means a single character often has multiple meanings.
Making J look like APL APL, in contrast with J, uses unique, distinctive symbols with less overloading.</description>
